2. Gameplay Mechanics
Pump Tournament’s core gameplay revolves around multiplayer real-time shooting battles, enhanced with Web3 features, real-time all-channel chat, advanced weapon pickups, and health regeneration mechanics, delivering an immersive and accessible social gaming experience.
Gameplay Flow
Shooting Battles:
Players join team or solo modes via browser, engaging in pixel-style dynamic arenas to defeat opponents through precise shooting and strategy, accumulating kills and team points.
Arenas feature diverse modes (e.g., Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Survival), with pickable advanced weapons (e.g., sniper rifles, rocket launchers) and health regeneration zones for strategic depth.
Competitive Challenges:
Players compete for leaderboard rankings based on kills, victories, and team contributions, with top performers earning $PTM rewards tied to mode difficulty.
Special events, such as time-limited tournaments or global showdowns, offer bonus $PTM for exceptional performance.
Social Interaction:
Real-time all-channel chat enables players to coordinate tactics, share strategies, or engage in casual banter during battles, fostering a lively community atmosphere.
Players can like, comment, or share highlights of kills or team plays, with community-voted top moments earning additional $PTM rewards.
Web3 Integration
Dynamic Token Rewards:
$PTM rewards are granted for kills, leaderboard rankings, event participation, and social contributions, funded by a buyback wallet.
Players can use $PTM to purchase premium weapon skins, power-ups, or custom arena themes, enhancing personalization.
Decentralized Identity Management:
Players log in via Solana wallets (e.g., Phantom, Solflare), with scores, rewards, and chat data recorded on-chain for transparency and security.
Buyback Reward Mechanism:
A buyback wallet periodically repurchases $PTM from the market to sustain the reward pool and community incentives.
Buyback funds are sourced from community activity budgets, with allocation optimized via smart contracts.
Social Features
All-Channel Chat:
A decentralized real-time chat system allows players to interact across all arenas, sharing tactics, jokes, or team plans.
Chat supports emojis, custom stickers, and moderation tools to ensure a positive environment.
Dynamic Leaderboards:
Leaderboards rank players based on kills, victories, or referral contributions, updated in real-time to fuel competition.
Top-ranked players earn $PTM rewards, with monthly champions receiving exclusive skins or badges.
Cross-Platform Sharing:
Players can share battle clips, kill highlights, or chat moments with referral codes or project links, driving organic growth.
Shared content includes dynamic effects (e.g., kill replays or team play montages) to enhance engagement.
AI-Powered Enhancements:
AI-driven tools generate personalized arena layouts or weapon spawn patterns, ensuring diverse gameplay experiences.
AI moderates chat in real-time, flagging inappropriate content to maintain community standards.
3. Token Economy
$PTM is Pump Tournament’s native token, built on Solana’s SPL Token standard and distributed via a 100% Pump.fun fair launch, designed to incentivize gameplay, social engagement, and community governance.
Token Utility
In-Game Spending:
Purchase premium weapon skins, dynamic power-ups, or exclusive arena themes to enhance gameplay and aesthetics.
Unlock advanced battle modes or create private arenas for tailored multiplayer experiences.
Reward Mechanism:
Rewards for kills, leaderboard rankings, event participation, and social contributions.
Buddy Link referrals grant $PTM and points, boosting community expansion.
Community Governance:
$PTM holders participate in on-chain voting to decide new skins, battle modes, or event themes.
Governance empowers players to shape the platform, fostering long-term engagement and token value alignment.
Deflationary and Incentive Mechanisms
Token Burn:
A portion of $PTM is burned during skin purchases or mode unlocks, reducing circulating supply.
Periodic community votes determine the burn of unallocated reward tokens to maintain economic balance.
Dynamic Buyback:
A buyback wallet regularly repurchases $PTM from the market to replenish the reward pool, ensuring incentive sustainability.
Buyback scale and frequency are determined through community governance, executed transparently via smart contracts.
Reward Optimization:
The reward pool adjusts dynamically based on player activity and community growth to prevent inflation.
Buyback funds are sourced from community activity budgets, with allocation refined through on-chain analytics.
